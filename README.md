### Hi there, I'm Anas Qadil! 
<div style="overflow-x: auto;">
  a passionate software developer with a diverse range of interests. I specialize in full-stack development, 
  which allows me to work on both the frontend and backend aspects of software applications. From crafting 
  intuitive user interfaces to implementing robust server-side logic, I enjoy building complete solutions that bring ideas to life.

  In addition to full-stack development, I have a keen interest in low-level programming. 
  Delving into the intricacies of computer architecture and operating systems fascinates me. 
  Whether it's optimizing code for performance or understanding how systems interact at a deeper level, I find great satisfaction in working closer to the hardware.

  Another area that captures my attention is malware analytics. With the ever-evolving 
  landscape of cybersecurity threats, studying and analyzing malware provides insights 
  into the techniques employed by malicious actors. This knowledge helps in devising robust 
  security measures and developing effective countermeasures to protect systems and data.
